title: "Busting Silos & Red Tape: DevOps in Federal Government"

---

**Abstract:**

All organizations face challenges in changing their culture and adopting DevOps
philosophies. This is especially true in many federal government agencies.
Through well-intentioned policies and procedures many agencies have created
extremely siloâ€™d environments where change is slow and difficult. Finishing the
last leg of large scale software development project acquisitions can be
particularly challenging and expensive. Barriers often impede getting hardware
and software systems system fully tested, transitioned, and up and running in
production on schedule.

Through our experience as a passionately DevOps focused software development
group within Carnegie University's Software Engineering Institute, a federally
funded research and development center, creating, delivering and transitioning
cutting edge software solutions to government organizations, we have struggled
with and overcame challenges in helping government to adopt DevOps principles.
Learn how we have conquered these challenges in shifting our government
stakeholders' thinking by coaching and initiating DevOps in their operational
and development environments.
