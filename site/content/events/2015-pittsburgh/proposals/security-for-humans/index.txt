title: "Security for Humans"

**Abstract:**

There are many stakeholders involved when you are creating or assembling a
security toolchain. How do you satisfy the different, and sometimes conflicting,
needs of these stakeholders in a responsive way?

We can use some of the concepts developed in the user experience domain to
create better security tooling. User personas allow us to map out different
roles that must interact with security to get their work done. These personas
are living and provide a fast feedback loop when paired with user interviews.
Giving direction while allowing freedom is a key tenet to integrating security
into different parts of your organization.

I've worked for several tech startups around the US. DevOps has been a necessity
at that scale. Currently I am the developer advocate for Conjur, a security
startup west of Boston. Doing whatever I can to help people operate complex
systems and still be happy is my goal. I live in Providence, RI with my wife
and two cats.
