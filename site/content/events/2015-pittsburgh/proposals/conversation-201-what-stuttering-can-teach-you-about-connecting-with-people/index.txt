title: "Conversation 201: what stuttering can teach you about connecting with people"

---

**Abstract:**

Developers are trained to communicate to things with a goal in mind. When you're
talking to something like, say a computer, you type in your code and it responds
by giving you back what you want. Nine times out of ten, it works perfectly.
Why, then, is it so difficult to do this same thing when talking to a client
about a project, updating a superior on your progress, or pitching an investor
your million-dollar idea? Because talking to people requires a special set of
skills - namely, empathy and a little bit of storytelling. In an industry filled
with brilliant minds, great ideas and mass disruption, so few of the best and
brightest know how to tell their compelling story. The takeaways from this
workshop will be learning how to value the listener and use vulnerability to
improve your social connection.
