title: "Confessions of a social engineer: Why developers are my favorite target"

**Abstract:**

Social engineers use a dangerous combination of technology and old fashioned con
artistry to infiltrate organizations every day. In this talk we'll walk through
the social engineering process including research, target selection, attack
selection, and attack execution. Learn to see the world through the eyes of a
social engineer and prevent yourself from being a victim.
