title: "Ethical and Sustainable On-Call"

**Abstract:**

It's 2:30 AM and you hear your phone buzz. You reach over and see an alert from
PagerDuty. That new service your team has been working on for a few weeks has
crashed and you don't know the first thing about debugging Clojure apps. After
crawling out of bed and logging into your company's VPN you discover your
co-workers have left you absolutely no documentation on what to do when
"bad things happen". You sit there wondering if you'll be getting back to bed
tonight.

Sound familiar? It doesn't have to be this way. On-call doesn't have to be a pit
of lost productivity and stress. On-call can actually be a very rewarding
experience that improves application stability, increases uptime, and avoids
those dreaded 2:30 AM PagerDuty notifications. Let's start thinking about
on-call for Humans.
