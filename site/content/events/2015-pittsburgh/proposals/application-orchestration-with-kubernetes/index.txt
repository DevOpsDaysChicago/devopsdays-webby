title: "Application Orchestration with Kubernetes"

---

**Abstract:**

How to take an app from your laptop to production utilizing the future of
container orchestration. It’s difficult to say with confidence that your app
will work in production without testing it, many people today have very complex
scripts which out outline deployment, testing and validation, and often rely on
late night pager calls and very brittle rollback scenarios. Additionally,
developers struggle with developing software on different platforms and SDK
versions that are hard to make consistent which results in different builds and
exceptions which are hard to resolve. We can finally stop saying, 'it works on
my machine' phrase since it will work the same on every machine. Other processes
in the past have attempted to solve the problem but are brittle and take time to
build out environments.

This talk will outline the process of how to deploy an app locally in
`docker-compose`, then scale it out to multiple servers running Kubernetes. From
there, the audience will see how to scale the app to achieve performance, manage
failures, debug, and understand best practices.

Containers are a great way to package, build, run and deploy apps and Docker has
make that practice very simple, however, it’s only really works well on a single
host. With the learnings from Google, Kubernetes is the open source container
orchestration offering which builds on Google's current infrastructure learnings
that we all can use in an Open Source model.
