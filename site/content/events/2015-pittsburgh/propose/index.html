### The [call for proposals](propose) closed <%= render(:partial => "/#{@eventhome}/_cfp_date_end") %>.

Questions about proposing a talk can be directed to
<%= render(:partial => "/#{@eventhome}/_email_proposals") %>.

### Full-length talks

This year, we are accepting all full-length (20-25 minute) proposals through our blinder system.
Talk proposals are accepted until <%= render(:partial => "/#{@eventhome}/_cfp_date_end") %>.

We are especially interested in talks regarding computer and information security,
as well as social engineering, as they relate to DevOps.
While we are looking for these specifically, all topics related to DevOps will be considered.

### Ignite talks

Ignite talks are five minute talks with twenty slides that automatically advance. [Read more about this exciting format.](http://www.devopsdays.org/pages/ignite-talks-format/)

Ignite talk proposals are not blinded. They are accepted until one week before the event.
