__Do you have an answer to one of these questions?__

* DevOps movement has been around for a few years now: Did anyone find out if it really helped your organization? Are there numbers for this?
* Did the culture of DevOps spread to other parts of your company? If not, why?
* Is DevOps the magic silver bullet which solved all your problems? What are the problems it didn't solve (although you thought it would)?
* Were there unexpected problems during your cultural change into DevOps?
* Did the required skill-set of people change after starting to do things DevOps-Style?
* Did people leave because you "went DevOps"? Was this good or bad or both?
* Have there been technical changes after the culture in your team changed?
* Did the change affect the business/sales/marketing side?
* And of course: Has DevOps affected you personally? How do you feel about the change it brought to your work?

* The impact DevOps has on traditional security/auditing/change control
* Building dashboards because #monitoringsucks
* The impact of DevOps on HR policies, and the hiring process
* Help prove that DevOps can scale beyond the 5-8 person web startups, we love traditional IT enterprise cases
* With all the automation, data is still a hard thing to handle, how does it affect DBA's, backup strategies, ...
