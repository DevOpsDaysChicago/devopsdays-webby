# How to make a shift from traditional model to DevOps?

## Abstract

DevOps is a recent addition and it is a common belief that hardcore followers of the traditional models such as Waterfall/Agile will be apprehensive to move to DevOps.

So, my talk focuses on how this transition can be made smoothly and highlight the benefits of doing so.
