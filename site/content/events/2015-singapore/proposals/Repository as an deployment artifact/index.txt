## Abstract

With the increase number of dependency between applications and third-party packages, it is quite often that we find ourselves bury in the dependency hell.

In scenario like this, wouldn't it be great if we can take a snapshot of the repository, version it and use it.

Even better if we can take cherry pick the required packages from the local repository and third-party repository and create a snapshot of it so that we can share and distribute the snapshot.

This ignite talk will be able using a tool called aptly to achieve this goal.
