talk_title: Agile Service Provider (Telco) Transformation – What does it take to be Agile?

---

# <%= @page.talk_title %>

## Abstract

As service providers(Telco's)  begin to transform their business to embrace Virtualization & Cloud ( ie SDN & NFV)  their network operations/service delivery teams needs to evolve. While Virtualization & Cloud make it easy to rapidly expand the size of infrastructure, but the habits and practices they used in the past with hardware-based infrastructure don't keep up.
The Network operations teams need to adopt IT’s DevOps practices to maximize the potential benefits of the evolving software-defined infrastructure.
This includes adopting new tools that enhance agility, implementing agile operational and organizational models and procedures, and in some cases adopting a new culture.  The benefits of such an approach are compelling: lower costs and increased agility, including the ability to implement new services in days rather than weeks or months

In this session, we will look at how to take advantage of technologies like cloud, virtualization, and configuration automation to manage IT infrastructure using  patterns, practices, and ideas that have been adopted from software development, especially Agile concepts, and brought into the Network  Operations world as part of the DevOps movement. Also, we will also go through the challenges and problems created by all these new tools, and the principles and mindset changes that a team needs to make to use them effectively
