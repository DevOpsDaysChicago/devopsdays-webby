# <%= @page.talk_title %>

## Abstract

At [Viki](https://www.viki.com/), we run a number of micro services that process thousands of requests per second in various geographical regions.
Micro service architecture helps us break down the complexity of building a large distributed system, but also introduces the complexity of debugging an issue.

This talk is about log processing at scale - building an Elasticsearch cluster that can handle tens of thousands of events per second from all levels of a micro-service container based architecture.
