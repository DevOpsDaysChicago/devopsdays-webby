## Bio

I am from Forest Technologies and have had experience in the DevOps field for the last few years, I am a CD and DevOps consultant and have implemented CI and CD processes at many client sites globally.

Having been on many different sites I have been provided with a view of what works well and not so well within the different DevOps practices.
