## Abstract

In a more highly automated tech and process oriented culture we often overlook the power of the individual. A lot of time is spent on optimizing and defining logical paths through our products, lifestyle, and outlook in life. Yet, one of the biggest constants are hardly considered nowadays. The human being. The individual who has a dream, a vision and a family. They have hopes and fears you cannot just quantify them in numbers.

 The purpose of this quick 5min conversation is to talk about Empathy. It is about the power of the individual you see in the mirror each day & of those who you cross paths with along the way. How can this impact your objectives and help you build the world you dream of?
