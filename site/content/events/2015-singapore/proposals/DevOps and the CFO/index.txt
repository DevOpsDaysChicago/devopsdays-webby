## Abstract

A (hopefully) slightly amusing talk about the TLA (three letter acronym) obsessions within the IT fraternity and how DevOps is no different.

Oh and I might add some useful content about the commercial ramifications on how to get your [painful] CFO bought into DevOps.

## Bio

I had a few media interviews and spoken at the AIIA (www.aiia.com.au) a couple of time, being a Red Hat APAC media spokesperson on DevOps, PaaS, and Development.
