title: "Continuous Integration May Have Negative Effects"
---

**Abstract:**

CI is a well-known and popular methodology, which is supposed to help software projects to stabilize their source code and make the entire development more predictable and surprise-free. Even though all this sounds very good in theory, the practice is different. in many companies Iâ€™ve been consulting with, the situation is very similar - continuous integration is causing troubles if being aggressively enforced. There is a very logical reason for that, which I will discuss at the session and will suggest a vendor-neutral solution.
