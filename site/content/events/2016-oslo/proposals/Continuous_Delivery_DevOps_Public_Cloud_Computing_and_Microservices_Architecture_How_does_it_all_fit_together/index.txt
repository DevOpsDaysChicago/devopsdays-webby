title: "Continuous Delivery, DevOps, Public Cloud Computing and Microservices Architecture: How does it all fit together?"
---

**Abstract:**
These practices can be viewed as the foundation of modern SaaS development and delivery. This talk aims to give a high level overview of what they are, what benefits they bring and more importantly how they are related and how they synergize. People who are already well-versed in these areas might pickup some useful inspiration for how to communicate about these ideas and bring that back into their own organization.
