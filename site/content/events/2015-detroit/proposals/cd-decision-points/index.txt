title: "Continuous Delivery Decision Points - getting software safely into production"
---

**Abstract:**
Not everyone is ready to do Continuous Delivery (CD) but there is pretty strong
agreement that moving in that direction is a good thing for many (most?)
applications. We hear a lot about the important of automation, but this talk
focuses on how to think about what you need to automate (hint: it’s not run
every test you can cobble together). At various steps in the delivery cycle you
need make the decision to either promote a piece of code to the next step or go
back and make further changes/fixes. Scaling development multiplies these
decision points as integration points in which teams collaborate around shared
functionality.

Too many organizations approach CD by automating the wrong things and just
increasing the amount of (often poor quality) code they have to maintain.
Others focus only on various provisioning/configuration management tools and
declare themselves “DevOps enabled” without really improving their ability to
deliver small chunks of new code. We’ll discuss what functioning CD really
looks like and why it helps the organization so much.

Also, we’ll discuss the requirement for valid test environments in order to
make good decisions, and what the tests should look like that enable our
decisions. Finally we will talk about how to assess and improve our overall
delivery system over time resulting in better software faster without the
stress and drama of major releases.
