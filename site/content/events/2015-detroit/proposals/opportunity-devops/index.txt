**Abstract:**
A play on the Opportunity Detroit campaign, this talk will casually stroll
through the opportunities of a devops culture and workflow. Introducing
opportunity in life, work and play. Life being everyday run operations and
development, Work being meeting dead lines and time to market, and play being
those side projects, experiments and interests that make you, the intricate
part of the team you are. With a focus on the changing culture and workflow of
teams in the current age, this talk will explore opportunities for developing
code to solve operational tasks in a dynamic environment. We will look at what
the opportunist has to gain, how the opportunist is to obtain, and where the
opportunist will transcend. Touching on monitoring, automating responses,
CI/CD, creating fan out workflows, and innovation.
