title: "Securing the Software Development Supply Chain"
---

**Abstract:**
Recently, it came to light that many apps in the iOS App Store had been
infected with malware via a malicious XCode distribution. While this particular
malware - "XCodeGhost" - mostly only affected developers in China who'd been
looking for a faster Xcode download mirror, it still brings to mind a point
that is - or should be! - keeping security engineers awake at night:

Even if our own teams wrote perfect, security-bug-free software (spoiler alert:
they don't!) there are many other points along the software development "supply
chain" where we could end up getting pwned. (Don't believe it? Just go "npm
install" something and watch the dependencies fly on by...)

As with most security problems, there aren't perfect solutions here, but we
certainly can "raise the bar" / "move the goalposts" / "<insert favorite idiom
here>". In this talk, we'll explore some strategies to build trust and reduce
risk across this supply chain, ranging from philosophical questions (how should
we evaluate what third party tools / libraries to use?) to in-the-weeds
technical issues (signatures vs. checksums, GPG and Git, TLS, ...)
