title: "Human Load Balancing – creative strategies for managing on-call"
---

**Abstract:**
I’ll present a taxonomy of both standard and totally non-standard ways
companies have organized their on-call schedules and escalation policies to
make sure incidents get handled quickly, work gets distributed fairly, and pain
is minimized.

Details:

* How people set up schedules (and why): Weekly vs daily vs odd-length rotations
* Constructing primary/secondary/tertiary backup layers
* Race-to-the-pager, round-robin, and availability-driven response
* Multi-tiered support and NOC use cases
