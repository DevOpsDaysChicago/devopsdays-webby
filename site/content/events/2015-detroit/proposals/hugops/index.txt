title: "#hugops in Practice: Operationalizing Empathy"
---

**Abstract:**
We often say that “DevOps is about empathy,” and we like how we’re breaking
down silos and generating all the warm fuzzies, but what does it actually mean
to be empathetic? We’ll look at specific tactics and strategies teams can use
to promote empathy and inclusivity within our organization.

**Details:**

* Communication frameworks and strategies: non-violent communication, hostage
negotiator strategies, defusing charged situations. What are the specific
skills and tactics used by masters of high-stress situations to calm people
and get them on the same page?
* Turning directional conflicts into approach conflicts: getting departments
to create common goals so that the scope of disagreements changes from what's
important to the simpler question of how to get there.
* Tricks and tactics for inclusivity and relationship-building within the team
and across your organization.
