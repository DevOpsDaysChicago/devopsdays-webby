**Abstract:**
A narrative of one engineer's experiences here in Michigan, traveling out to the Bay Area, what I found there, and why I came back. Emphasis on:

* observations about why you might want to go out West
* the overlooked competitive advantages of SE Michigan
* the kindling startup culture here
* why an engineer in the tech hub of the world might want to be here instead


**Speaker:**
