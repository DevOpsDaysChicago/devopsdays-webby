**Abstract:**
A sarcastic guide on how (not) to work in, with, and around a DevOps team.

changed to protect the innocent, and content is heavily inflated for impact.

Topics include:

* Pigs and Walls
* Fortified Silos
* Mythical Man-Meetings
* Bruce Wayne, Sr. Engineer
* The Horizontal Tooling Methodology
* IaIK (Infrastructure as Institutional Knowledge)
* Oracles and You
* Nihilism in the Workplace
* Fear-based Scaling
* Security by Force
