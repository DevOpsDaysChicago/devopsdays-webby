**Abstract:**
The industry is starting to 'get' Continuous Delivery, and automated
deployment pipelines are the backbone of your delivery capability. However,
with the choice of tools, philosophies, and patterns increasing, picking a path

it works out. Immutable servers, AMI artefacts, baking vs frying: Max and Max
(not a typo) will navigate the modern day options and help clarify the benefits
and shortcomings using a combined ~20 years experience.
