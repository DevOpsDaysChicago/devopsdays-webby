title: "How To Train Your(self) Dragon-Style To Submit Talks"
---

**Abstract:**
Deciding to submit a talk for consideration at an event can be a troubling
thing - what if my idea isn't good enough? Do I think big enough thoughts to
share a stage with Thought Leaders? Why would anyone care what I have to say?

In this Ignite, I will share with you my secrets for identifying a talk idea,
deciding where to submit, and help give advice on overcoming the dreaded
Imposter Syndrome, to help you get past the worries of being "not good enough"
and break through to share your individual expertise and insight with audiences
who would love to hear it!



**Speaker:**
Matt Stratton, Chef
