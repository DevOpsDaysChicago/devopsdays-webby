title: "Cloud Anti-Patterns: Micro services, Containers and Large Scale Search gone wrong"
---

**Abstract:**
The value of micro services, containers, and continuous deployment is powerful
only when brought together in a logical, scalable and platform agnostic manner.

Moreover, when used in the wrong way, it is fairly easy to shoot your self (and
your entire application) in the foot. For eg: Micro services can be used to
either create unnecessary pockets of redundancy, or used to isolate
functionality and directly be an ally of efficient continuous deployment. I
have seen more incorrect usages of containers and micro services than Iâ€™d like
to admit, and a few key components are frequently left out of the cloud-native
architecture while starting down this path.

Using the micro service paradigm is not a panacea for all problems, because one
is creating a large-scale distributed cluster, in essence. Another aspect that
is frequently neglected is large-scale containerized search in a cloud-native
environment, a governance model around micro services and cloud orchestration.
For instance, API frameworks like swagger.io enhance the usability of micro
services by documenting the API functionality in real-time alongside the API
contract. A micro service is only as useful as the interface contract that it
has with other services in the application eco system.

Based on my experience over multiple cloud deployments, I will share a
collection of anti-patterns and best practices to build production-ready
cloud-native applications.
