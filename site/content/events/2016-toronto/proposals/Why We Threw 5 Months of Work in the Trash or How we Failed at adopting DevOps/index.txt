title: "Why We Threw 5 Months of Work in the Trash; or How we Failed at adopting DevOps"
---

**Abstract:**

Last summer we started an engineering enablement engagement in Seattle. Very quickly we decided DevOps enablement had a lot of potential and started our work...5 months later the "DevOps" part of work was shot down by management due to lack of result. We will take a look at three main reasons that we failed. These are pitfalls that can happen in any company and any project.
