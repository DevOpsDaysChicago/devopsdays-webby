title: "Docker Container Lifecycles - Problem or Opportunity?"
---

**Abstract:**

Docker is hot. However, as Docker container use spreads into more mature production pipelines, there can be issues about control of Docker images to ensure they are production-ready.  Is a promotion-based model appropriate to control and track the flow of Docker images from development to production?
We will demonstrate how to implement a promotion model for docker images, and then show how to distribute them to any kind of consumer, being it a customer or a data center.

**Speaker:**

Baruch Sadogursky (a.k.a JBaruch) is the Developer Advocate of JFrog, the home of Artifactory - the Universal Artifact Repository, and Bintray - the Universal Distribution Hub.

For a living he hangs out with the JFrog tech leaders, writes some code around Artifactory and Bintray, and then speaks and blogs about all that. He does it repeatedly for the last dozen of years and enjoys every moment of it.
