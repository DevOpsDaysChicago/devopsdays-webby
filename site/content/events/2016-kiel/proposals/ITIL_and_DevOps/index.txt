title: "ITIL and DevOps can be friends"
---

**Abstract:**

ING is a worldwide financial institution, based in the Netherlands. The IT department of the Netherlands manages a mix of off the shelf applications and in house built software. Traditionally development was governed by CMMi and IT Servicemanagement by ITIL processes. Three years ago the developers started working in Agile/Scrum teams, dropping CMMi. The next step was to involve Operations as well and transform to an DevOps organisation, striving for Continuous Delivery.

In a lot of Agile organisations ITIL is considered the evil soul sucking epiphany of bureaucracy. But is it really? If we look at the tasks you perform in the ITIL processes Incident management, Problem management and Change management, you will find that a lot of those you still need to perform in an Agile/Scrum way of work. And that there actually is a lot of value in making some rules on how we want to interact in these processes between teams. But we may call the task differently than we were used to in ITIL. And we may choose to use different tools to handle parts of the process. We call this adaptation of ITIL Agile ITSM.

This talk focuses on the adaptations we have made to our ITSM processes to accommodate the requirements of an Agile/Scrum way of work. Proving that there is still value in a lot of the things we used to do in ITIL And that there is no real conflict between Agile and ITIL.
