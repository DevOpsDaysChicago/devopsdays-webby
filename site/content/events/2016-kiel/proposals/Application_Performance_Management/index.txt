title: "The Role Of Application Performance Management In DevOps And Continuous Delivery"
---

**Abstract:**

Enterprises are rapidly adopting DevOps and Agile processes to drive faster innovation and competitively differentiate. A key part of this shift is the ability to leverage Continuous Integration and Delivery practices to manage and deploy smaller code pushes at higher velocity to meet business needs.

Industry evidence, backed by analyst research, suggests that approximately 80% of all business service outages are caused by release, change, and configuration processes. Where the business is challenging enterprise IT to streamline processes to drive innovation, how do we enable speed and rapid change, while simultaneously balancing quality and performance concerns?

In this session, John Rakowski, Director of Technology Strategy at AppDynamics will explain the role and benefits of Application Performance Management (APM) solutions in DevOps, Continuous Integration and Delivery environments. He will refer to case studies on how organisations have integrated APM into their software development lifecycle so that attendees can ensure releases, change and configuration don't cause business service outages.
