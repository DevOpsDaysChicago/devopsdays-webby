title: "The Art of Decomposing Monoliths"
---

**Abstract:**

Microservices are the new black. You've heard about them, you've read about them, you may have even implemented a few, but sooner or later you'll run into the age-old conundrum: How do I break my monolith apart? Where do I draw service boundaries?

In this talk you will learn several widely-applicable strategies for decomposing your monolithic application, along with their respective risks and the appropriate mitigation strategies. These techniques are widely used at Wix, took us a long time to develop and have proven consistently effective; hopefully they will help you avoid the same battle scars.

**Speaker:**

Currently the Head of Backend Engineering at Wix, Kfir has seen some things during the 17 years in the field.
Unfortunately for him, Kfir has not lost his passion for hands on development, even though it usually collides with his
day to day job of architecting and managing 70 developers. His past includes working in various networking companies, 
and it seems that the past continues to haunt him - while he is working today to bring Wix to the NodeJS age, he can't seem to forget that he wrote server-side JavaScript on a Netscape server a long while ago.
