title: "Keep it simple, stupid! (A reminder to myself and a surprisingly accurate analogy to how (not) to build sustainable systems)"
---

**Abstract:**

The journey of how the idea of a simple personal blog turned into an unmanageable and expensive system, its similarities to unsustainable systems on a bigger scale and the importance of going back to square one.

**Speaker:**

Consultant at Init AB currently mainly working on building easily accessible (and simple) infrastructure systems and an interest in how to build strong and diverse teams and including environments.
