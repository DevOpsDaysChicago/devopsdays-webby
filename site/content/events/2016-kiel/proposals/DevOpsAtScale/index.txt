title: "DevOps @Scale"
---

**Abstract:**

Remember the times when one server was enough? And a guy named "sysadmin" was babysitting it along with his other duties of installing MS Office for everybody?

For better or for worse, those times are long gone. Today, companies manage tens of thousands of servers and perform thousands of production changes per day.

In this talk we will look at the resources, techniques and tools needed for managing DevOps at Scale and we will discuss the challenges that companies encounter when they hit it.

**Speaker:**

Baruch Sadogursky (a.k.a JBaruch) is the Developer Advocate of JFrog, the home of Artifactory - the Universal Artifact Repository, and Bintray - the Universal Distribution Hub.

For a living he hangs out with the JFrog tech leaders, writes some code around Artifactory and Bintray, and then speaks and blogs about all that. He does it repeatedly for the last dozen of years and enjoys every moment of it.
