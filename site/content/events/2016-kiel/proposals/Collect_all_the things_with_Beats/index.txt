title: "Collect all the things with Beats"
---

**Abstract:**

The ELK stack is widely used to collect logs with Logstash, analyze and search the data with Elasticsearch, and visualize what is happening in your system. Now there is a new platform for shipping many types of operational data: Beats. It can be used to collect, parse, and ship any type of data.
This talk provides an overview of the Beats platform and dives into gathering system metrics, tapping your wire data, and using real-time file analytics. Finally, we take a look at building custom data shippers to get a complete overview of your infrastructure.

**Speaker:**

Philipp is a Developer Advocate at Elastic, spreading the love and knowledge of full-text search, analytics, and real-time data. He is a frequent speaker at conferences and meetups about all things Elasticsearch, databases, cloud computing, and devops. Philipp lives in Vienna where he enjoys experimenting with software, organizing meetups, and sports.
