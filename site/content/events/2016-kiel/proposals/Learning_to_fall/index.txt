**Abstract:**

When people talk about advantages of microservices, easy scaling and resilience comes up frequently. What they don't usually tell you, is that robustness does not come for free. If you don't put extra effort into gracefully failing when one of your dependencies is down, microservices will only make your system even more brittle.

In my presentation I will recount our journey from an instabile monolith to a robust set of microservices with a special focus on architectural patterns that helped us along the way.
