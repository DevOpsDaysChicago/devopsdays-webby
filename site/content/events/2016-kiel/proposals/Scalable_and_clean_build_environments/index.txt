---

**Abstract:**

By combining Jenkins CI server and Docker application containers you can provide dynamically created build environments that are free of old build fragments. There is not only one way to realize such scenario and we will show you three of them we have tried.

**Speaker:**

Stefan supports teams in a variety of activities, with a strong understanding of both operational and development aspects. These activities range from setting and maintaining customer development environments and tools to acting as Agile Coach.
