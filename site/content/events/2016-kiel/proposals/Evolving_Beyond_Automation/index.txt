title: "Continuous Testing for DevOps: Evolving Beyond Automation"
---

**Abstract:**

Attend this session to learn why and how Continuous Testing's real-time objective assessment of an application's business risks is a critical component of DevOps:

Throughout the process, business stakeholders have instant access to feedback on whether their expectations are being met, enabling them to make informed decisions.

At the time of the critical "go/no go" decision, there is an instant, objective assessment of whether your organization's specific expectations are satisfied--reducing the business risk of a fully-automated Continuous Delivery process.

Defects are eliminated at the point when they are easiest, fastest, and least costly to fix--a prime principle of being "lean."

Continuous measurement vs. key metrics means continuous feedback, which can be shared and used to refine the process.
