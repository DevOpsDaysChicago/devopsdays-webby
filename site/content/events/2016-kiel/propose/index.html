### Please view and comment on the [submitted proposals](../proposals/)

<!--
<hr>
There are three ways to propose a session:
<ol>
  <li><strong><em>A proposal for a talk/panel</em></strong> during the conference part : these are 30 minute slots that will have the full attention of all attendees, as everybody will be in that one room.</li>
  <li><strong><em>An Ignite talk</em></strong> that will be presented during the<a href="/pages/ignite-talks-format"> Ignite sessions</a>. These are 5 minutes slots with slides changing every 15 seconds (20 slides total) which are also presented to all attendees in one room</li>
  <li><strong><em>Open Space session</em></strong> : even without a prepared presentation we welcome the discussion and interaction by having people propose a session on the fly during Open Space. Check the <a href="/pages/open-space-format">Open Space explanation</a> for more information.
</ol>

### Even if you don't propose, please consider [commenting on proposals submitted by others](../proposals/)

Our main criteria to make it to the top selection are:

- _original content_: content not yet presented at other conferences, or a new angle to an existing problem
- _new presenters_: people who are new to the space and have insightful stuff to say; we want to hear everybody's voice
- _no vendor pitches_: as much as we value vendors and sponsors, we just don't think this is the right forum. You can demo at your table or during Open Space.

<strong>How to submit a proposal:</strong> Follow the link below and fill 
out the the form to submit a proposal. If you have any questions don't hesitate to send an email to [<a href="mailto:<%= render(:partial => "/#{@eventhome}/_email_proposals") %>"><%= render(:partial => "/#{@eventhome}/_email_proposals") %></a>].

<!--<strong>How to submit a proposal:</strong> Send an email to [<a href="mailto:<%= render(:partial => "/#{@eventhome}/_email_proposals") %>"><%= render(:partial => "/#{@eventhome}/_email_proposals") %></a>] with the following information
<ol>

	<li>Type (presentation, panel discussion, moderated general discussion, debate, etc.,ignite)</li>
	<li>Description or abstract</li>
</ol>-->


<!--
We encourage especially women and newcomer to submit a proposal.

<strong>We are looking for ...</strong>
<ul>
<li>new ideas and novel concepts, especially if this is your first time presenting on this topic</li>
<li>practical approaches</li>
<li>strong human elements and culture</li>
<li>topics how to achieve diversity and to deal with problems in this matter</li>
</ul>

<strong>Rules:</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Be specific... we aren't mind readers (a description of about 20 lines is about right)</li>
	<li>Detail is good... but not as important as explaining why your proposal would be interesting</li>
	<li>Propose your own talk; don't have someone else do it for you.</li>
	<li>Nominations welcome... if you know someone who has content/experience relevant to the DevOps conversation, please point us in their direction!</li>
	<li>Multiple proposals welcome... just follow the other rules</li>
</ul>
