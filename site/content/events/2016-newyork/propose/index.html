<!--
There are two ways to propose a session:
<ol>
	<li><b><i>A proposal for a talk/panel during the conference part:</i></b> These are 30 minute slots that will have the full attention of all attendees, as everybody will be in that one room.</li>
  <li><b><i>An <a href="/pages/ignite-talks-format/">ignite talk</a></i></b> that will be presented during the Ignite sessions. These are 5 minutes slots with slides changing every 15 seconds (20 slides total) which are also presented to all attendees in one room</li>
</ol>

Our main criteria to make it to the top selection are:
<ul>
<li><i>original content</i>: content not yet presented at other conferences, or a new angle to an existing problem</li>
<li><i>new presenters</i>: people who are new to the space and have insightful stuff to say; we want to hear everybody's voice</li>
<li><i>no vendor pitches</i>: we value vendors and sponsors, but this is not the right forum</li>
<li><i>on theme</i>: our themes this year are inclusivity, complexity, and empathy; we want to hear your takes on these themes</i>
</ul>

<b><i>How to submit a proposal</i></b>: Send an email to [<a href="mailto:proposals-nyc-2016@devopsdays.org">proposals-nyc-2015@devopsdays.org</a>] with the following information:
<ol>
	<li>Working title (can be changed later)</li>
	<li>Type (presentation, panel discussion, or ignite)</li>
	<li>Description or abstract</li>
</ol>

<b>Rules:</b>
<ul>
<li>Be specific... we aren't mind readers (a description of about 20 lines is about right)</li>
<li>Detail is good... but not as important as explaining why your proposal would be interesting</li>
<li>Propose your own talk... don't have your marketing department do it for you</li>
<li>Nominations welcome... if you know someone who has content/experience relevant to the devops conversation, please point us in their direction!</li>
<li>Multiple proposals welcome... just follow the other rules</li>
