We are proud to announce 6th Annual DevOps Day LA, to be held Friday, January 22, 2016, co-located
with <a href="http://www.socallinuxexpo.org">SCALE 14x</a>, at the Pasadena Convention Center.<p>

DevOps Day LA is a day dedicated to the DevOps community, and professionals who wish to improve
the interaction and integration between these traditional silos of Development and Operations.
We're looking for speakers interested in presenting to this forum. The theme for the conference
this year is "Surprise!", a phrase that all too often fills devops teams with dread, but can also
be positive.

<a href="./propose">Proposals</a> for sessions, open spaces, and ignite style talks will be reviewed through Nov 30th.
