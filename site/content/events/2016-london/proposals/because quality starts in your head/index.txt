title: ...because quality starts in your head!
---

**Abstract:**

"Quality is everyone ´s responsibility", is one important quote of William Edwards 

Demming. This means that quality is also a question of your personal inner attitude. 

Today high quality is an important criteria to remain competitive at the market. 

Changing the users story into an accepted user story is helpful to define the level of 

quality to be able to focus on it during the whole development process. Early testing 

help to walk the line. Prompt feedbacks are useful to save time. 

But this way of working presumes a common understanding for quality and the way 

how to achieve it. It also presumes to value the common goals in a very high way. 

These ideas work very well – in theory! But reality shows us that human beings are 

much more complex than the just logical driven: feelings, comforts, biases, 

prejudices, anxieties, habits, moods, experiences, proud and the fear to fail define 

our way of working, acting, thinking and making decisions. 

To bring the theoretical approach of quality to success it needs to become the 

common mindset of employees and managers! To reach the goal of quality we need 

to talk about communication, transparency, trust, responsibility and culture in a multi- 
facetted way! We need to talk about the quality, which starts inside your head...
