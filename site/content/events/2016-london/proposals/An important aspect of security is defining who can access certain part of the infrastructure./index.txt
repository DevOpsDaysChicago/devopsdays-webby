title: An important aspect of security is defining who can access certain part of the infrastructure. 
---

**Abstract:**

Firewall rules and policies define which communication channels are allowed. Authorize different ssh keys on different instances. Whitelist IPs which are well known and won't change that often.

Sometimes all those restrictions will make you feel miserable. Issues will raise when people are not available or located in a non familiar place. Circumstances like this when the only operational guy with an internet connection is in an airport are not that uncommon.

To avoid spending time in reconfiguring firewall or, even worse, opening the all production network to anyone in the airport we can leverage a well know system called port knocking. Port knocking will allow you to access with a high level of security production.

In this talk we will walk through an Ansible roles that we made openly available to setup fknop on a jump server.

In this session the audience will learn
* fundamentals of securing a server
* creating secure infrastructure backdoor
* firewall port knocking concept
* automate fwknopd installation and iptables configuration

**Speaker:**
