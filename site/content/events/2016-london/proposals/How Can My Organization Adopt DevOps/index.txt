title: How Can My Organization Adopt DevOps
---

**Abstract:**

In most organizations bridging the gap from current development and operations practices to DevOps is a daunting challenge. This presentation describes a structured approach to adopting DevOps that can help to tame that challenge.
The approach consists of the following stages:
0) Identify the problem – why do you want to adopt DevOps?
1) Get buy-in - who do you need to convince and how to make your case to start
2) Assess DevOps capability/maturity in your organization – where are you at?
3) Pick an adoption Strategy – typical adoption strategies include bottom up, top down, incremental, big bang
4) Define a Roadmap - set goals for what your adoption will achieve
5) Identify Stakeholders and their issues – who is going to benefit? How?
6) Acquire the resources you need to be successful – people, coaches, money, hardware, training
7) Define metrics and take baseline measurements
8) Build an adoption backlog for the goals on your roadmap
9) Implement adoption backlog items
10) Measure the results, decide what to do next
11) Repeat 6 & 7 until done
12) Review Roadmap, compare metrics with baseline, publish results, decide what to do next
