title:  Deployment Scripts Are Dead, Meet Rultor
---

**Abstract:**

Continuous delivery means automation of deployment procedures. Usually, we automate them with BASH scripts and run them manually. This is past. Rultor.com is the future.

Abstract: Rultor.com is a free open source hosted solution for automation of routine DevOps operations, including deployment and release. BASH scripts executed manually is the past of DevOps. Rultor is the future, which is free and very intuitive. It is a GitHub chatbot, with a set of servers provided for free and a simplistic user interface. Over 300 projects are under Rultor's management. Let me demonstrate how this technology can simplify your everyday operations.
