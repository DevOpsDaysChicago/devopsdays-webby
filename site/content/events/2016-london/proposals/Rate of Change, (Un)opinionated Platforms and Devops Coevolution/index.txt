title: "Rate of Change, (Un)opinionated Platforms and Devops Coevolution"
---

**Abstract:**

The recent explosion in new technologies for running software systems;
architectures based around smaller and smaller (micro)services; the
devops movement and operators and developers working closely together.

In this talk I'll argue that these threads, while somewhat separate,
are all related at a higher level and the changes we are seeing are
the result of coevolution - where a change in one practice has a
direct effect on others. The talk will touch on:

* The operational cost of smaller and smaller components, and the
resulting macro increase in complexity
* Why different types of teams find it easier (or harder) to adopt
certain types of software
* How the skills and composition of teams change as a result of the
adoption of platforms/devops/microservices (or is it the other way
around?)
* Why the rapid rate of change resists traditional standards, and
examples of lightweight alternatives

The audience should take away:

* An appreciation of how the adoption of practices like devops and
microservices, and tools like platform as a service, are
interconnected
* A better understanding of how devops emerged in widely different organisations
* How coevolution means cause and effect could be either way round,
and how to use that to change your organisation
