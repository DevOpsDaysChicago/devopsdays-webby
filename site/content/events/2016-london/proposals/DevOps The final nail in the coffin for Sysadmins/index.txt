**Abstract:**

“I have made a career out of system administration. I recent years I've witnessed the role of the system administrator evolve alongside changes in how software is delivered and consumed. My career has had to evolve too.
 
The DevOps movement is now accelerating and the adoption of DevOps practices is becoming more widespread.  How will the role of a Sysadmin change and are we nearing the day that Sysadmins are no longer required?”

**Speaker:**
