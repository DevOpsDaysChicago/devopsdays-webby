title:  "The State-of Practice for DevOps: Whatâ€™s missing in 2016? A cross-organizational view"
---

**Abstract:**

DevOps can be as much about discipline as it is about tools and practices. Management practice for development and deployment must keep pace the realities of the market and the disruptive technology trends. DevOps has been evolving for the front-line in organizations and in many cases remains in a silo either within a development group or in IT operations. One thing for sure, DevOps is still evolving and is misaligned with the overall management objectives of a company.  This is particularly true at the enterprise level.

After 30 years to tech evolution and innovations the definition and practice of DevOps must move beyond isolated tool to a cross-organizations management model that links DevOps to the overall performance of the company. In essence a case needs to be made beyond the tools and procedures to an effective management models that aims to optimize performance across business cycles.
