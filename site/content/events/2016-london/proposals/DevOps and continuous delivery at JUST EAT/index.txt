title: DevOps and continuous delivery at JUST EAT
---

**Abstract:**

Come see a demo of how JUST EAT got from ~10 deployments a year in 2010 to ~800 in 2014. I will kill some randomly-chosen things in production and talk about how I can get away with it on stage.

I'll illustrate how we:
automated a lot of the pain out of our day to day (what did that need?)
can get from done-on-workstation to ready-for-production inside 20 minutes (and why that last bit sucks!)
find when we pushed something bad (what do we do about it?)
know about failure before our customers do (where do we look?)
have reaped the cultural benefits of letting engineers fix things (does the business care we ship several times a day?)
still have problems in paradise ;-)

**Speaker:**

Peter Mounce
