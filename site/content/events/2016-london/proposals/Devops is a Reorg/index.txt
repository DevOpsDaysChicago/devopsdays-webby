title: "Devops is a Reorg"
---

**Abstract:**

Breaking down the silos between development and operations is the
starting point for devops adoption,  but is this sufficient ? for a
number of organisations adopting devops really is a full reorganisation
with a lot of team members getting new roles.  This talk will guide you
trough a number of these changes.   What roles dissapear, what skills
remain but in a different role.  This talk is based on real changes in
actuall large organisations.  It will cover merging teams, relocating
teams, changing the management of a team, the new role of architects,
and many more.

**Speaker:**
Kris Buytaert
