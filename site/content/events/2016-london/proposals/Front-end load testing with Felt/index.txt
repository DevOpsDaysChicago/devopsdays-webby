title: Front-end load testing with Felt
---

**Abstract:**

I've been working on a load tester that works by starting a lot of (headless) browsers. The goal of Felt (front-end load testing) is to allow a developer to load test a front-end web application without having to setup different load scenarios for all the API calls and external resources. The system works with basic scenarios allowing you to set up a path through your application for the browser to follow.

The advantage of using real browsers is that you get a real load testing environment, including all the javascript, api calls and other front-end resources â€¦

The goal of my talk is to get feedback on Felt and see where I can improve the project so it becomes a useful tool for devops people.
