title: "Performance testing with Vegeta"
---

**Abstract:**

I'd like to do a whistle stop walk though of hi volume (multiple k requests a second) testing of an API using Vegeta (https://github.com/tsenart/vegeta) including generating traffic using EC2 instances as hosts, Python for setup and BASH for easy collating of results.

Nothing super complex (it's only 5 minutes after all) but covering all the major activities needed for both peak volume and soak testing.

**Speaker:**
Oliver Wood
