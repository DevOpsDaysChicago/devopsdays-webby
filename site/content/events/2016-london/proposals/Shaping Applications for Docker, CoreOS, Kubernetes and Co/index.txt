title: Shaping Applications for Docker, CoreOS, Kubernetes and Co
---

**Abstract:**

The buzz around containers has not yet reached it climax. Rolling out
big scale heterogeneous applications has just started. This talk is
about real customer projects, which use docker to deploy applications
in a rapidly environment changing by kubernetes and CoreOS. We
followed a very strict approach, separating persistent and stateless
applications and run everything in small units orchestrated by
Kubernetes. With our own tools we could create descriptions of
environments very rapidly, creating full complex environments with a
single command. Examples in Java, Python and Ruby are shown. Security
has been addressed to pass an extensive security audit. Using the
latest feature of systemd on Linux on CoreOS, we could move the
configuration management into the kubernetes domain.
