title: "You don't scale"
---

**Abstract:**


Back in 2008 I worked myself into hospital, collapsing a disc in my spine and ending up taking 3 months off work and having some surgery.  I'd like to highlight how we all focus on scaling servers, but need to look after ourselves.   It's a topic I'd given several lightening talks on before (see https://twitter.com/hypersupermeta/status/581507212855668737 from ScaleSummit)



**Speaker:**
Oliver Wood
