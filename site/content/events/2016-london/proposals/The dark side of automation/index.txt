title: The dark side of automation
---

**Abstract:**

Civilization advances by extending the number of important operations which we can perform without thinking about them." This quote from Alfred North Whitehead (1861-1947), a British mathematician who became an American philosopher, describes an attitude to automation that can turn good intentions into bad results. 
Without thinking automation can easily end up in managing crisis rather than in controlling a system. 
This talk is about negative effects of automation. It's about the mindset that may lead to bad results. And it's about how DevOps can help to avoid automation pitfalls. 
The role of monitoring, culture and sharing in successful automation projects are considered from a systems thinking perspective.
