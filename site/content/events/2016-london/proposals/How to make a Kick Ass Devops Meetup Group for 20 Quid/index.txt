title: How to make a Kick Ass Devops Meetup Group for 20 Quid
---

**Abstract:**

In September 2013 I started a local Devops Meetup in Leeds (5th largest urban area in the UK) when 7 enthusiasts met in a pub - now in 2016 I have 100 people rush to grab tickets and attract speakers from major vendors/players, the meetups still retains the focus on what Devops is with it's roots back to Debois and Shafer still intact. This talk is step by step guide on how I did this and how you can too, it's also a rallying call for how we can all help each other to make meetups better regionally, nationally and beyond.
