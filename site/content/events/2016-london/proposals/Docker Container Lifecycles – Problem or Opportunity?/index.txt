title: Docker Container Lifecycles â€“ Problem or Opportunity? 
---

**Abstract:**

Docker is hot. However, as Docker container use spreads into more mature production pipelines, there can be issues about control of Docker images to ensure they are production-ready.  Is a promotion-based model appropriate to control and track the flow of Docker images from development to production?
We will demonstrate how to implement a promotion model for docker images, and then show how to distribute them to any kind of consumer, being it a customer or a data center.
