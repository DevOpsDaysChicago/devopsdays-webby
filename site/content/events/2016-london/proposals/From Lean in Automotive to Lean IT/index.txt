title: From Lean in Automotive to Lean IT
---

**Abstract:**

The content of the presentation would articulate around:
- History of Lean in Automotive (from Henry Ford to Toyota and now more modern iterations and implementation of Lean).
- What this is telling us:
o Produce to Demand
o Continuous improvements driven from MIS
o Total Quality
o Organisation à Optimisation à Automation à Relocation
o Benefits not only done through robotics – Manual labour still has a place
o Create capacity
o Use capacity to grow business
o Efficiencies measured by the output
- What are the parallels with IT?
o MVP
o Standardisation yet individuality
o Simplification
o Process improvements
o DevOps Automation
o Where automation matters and where not?
o Application of Lean Principles in IT
o Factors of waste in IT (adapted from Six Sigma)
- How do we progress about it?
o Lean vs Agile
o Smaller batch sizes
o Business buy-in
o Architecture evolution – sustainability of the estate
o Quality as a standard
o Focus on core differentiators
o Optimise the end to end flow
- What does this mean for DevOps? – DevOps is at the centre of all this:
o Deliver faster – reduce "tax” on releasing through Automation
o Track, monitor and address process inefficiencies continuously (eg. Employee onboarding process, poor performance of VDIs, endless process of obtaining server space, etc). Technical solutions are simple, issues often start at the organisational level
o Create MIS to understand inefficiencies
o Know what to automate and what not
o Capture and document processes because once you know the process, you can start the journey to optimise
o Support a CIP plan top down (Executive track) and Bottom Up (team empowerment)
