title: DevOps @Scale
---

**Abstract:**

Remember the times when one server was enough? And a guy named “sysadmin” was babysitting it along with his other duties of installing MS Office for everybody?

For better or for worse, those times are long gone. Today, companies manage tens of thousands of servers and perform thousands of production changes per day.

In this talk we will look at the resources, techniques and tools needed for managing DevOps at Scale and we will discuss the challenges that companies encounter when they hit it.

**Speaker:**
