title: How to Install the ELK Stack on AWS
---

**Abstract:**

The open source ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana) is downloaded 500,000 times every month, making it the world’s most popular log management platform. While ELK is easy to download, it is difficult to install and manage. In this tutorial, we will show how to set up production-grade ELK on AWS environments quickly and easily.

One of this year's themes is vendor relationships -- and everyone's relationship with the ELK Stack open source platform is only going to become more and more important as more and more people use it.

Elasticsearch is a NoSQL database that is based on the Lucene search engine. Logstash is a log pipeline tool that accepts inputs from various sources, executes different transformations, and exports the data to various targets. Kibana is a visualization layer that works on top of Elasticsearch.

Together, these three products are most commonly used in log analysis in IT environments (though there are many more use cases for the ELK Stack starting including business intelligence, security and compliance, and web analytics). Logstash collects and parses logs, and then Elasticsearch indexes and stores the information. Kibana then presents the data in visualizations that provide actionable insights into one’s environment.

Setting up the ELK Stack on AWS might seem like an easy task, but we have gone through several iterations in our architecture and have made some mistakes in our deployments that have turned out to be common in the industry.

In this tutorial, we will go through what we did and explain what worked and what failed -- and why. This session is geared towards people who use are interested in using ELK to perform log analysis and check operational issues in their AWS environments.
