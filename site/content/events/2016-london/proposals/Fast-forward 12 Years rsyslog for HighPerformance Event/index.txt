title: "Fast-forward 12 Years: rsyslog for High-Performance Event
Processing"
---

**Abstract:**

rsyslog was born about 12 years ago, as a fork of syslogd. In all this
time, it grew a lot of nice functionalities. First of all, it’s
modular, which means you can do things like tail files, parse
unstructured event intro structured JSON, and output to an array of
destinations such as MongoDB or Elasticsearch.

There’s also a new (new as in “introduced 4 years ago”) configuration
language, which allows powerful filtering, local variables, and lots
of other tricks. Last but not least, you can choose buffer data (in
memory, on disk, or a combination) per input and per action. This
effectively allows you to route data in whichever way you want and
also handle intermittent network failures or slowness in your
destinations.

Like any other open-source project, rsyslog doesn’t pretend to be
perfect. There’s lots of work ahead in terms of documentation and ease
of use, for example. Here, I’ll show the important features of
rsyslog, some of the best practices (you’ll need a few tweaks to get
to that 1M EPS per machine that some people report), how we want to
move things forward and how you can help with that
