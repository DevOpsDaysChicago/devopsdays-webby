title: The "House of Cards" game in your organization
---

**Abstract:**

You all know or have heard about the film "House of Cards" of Netflix? The truth is, 

that a lot of the hidden political decisions happen each day in a lot of organizations! 

The negative effects of such personal goals – which often are counterproductive to 

the companies’ or team ´s goals – are immeasurable! What about you organization 

and the "House of Cards” game? In modern IT practices like "continuous everything” 

time is a limiting factor; no time left for clearing up misunderstandings and problems 

caused by that sneaky and dangerous game! In DevOps surrounding trust is 

important to break away from new silos. 

In this session you will learn how important transparency is to avoid this offstage 

game. You will see that an atmosphere of trust will reduce the readiness of the 

employees for playing this game. 

But still the question is, how to achieve transparency and build an atmosphere of 

trust! See how a strong communication and a modern way of leadership will be 

valuable tools helping you to build up a successful DevOps reality with common 

goals.
