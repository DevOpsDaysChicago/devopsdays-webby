## The Four Questions (Every Monitoring Engineer gets asked)

Why is this monitoring system different from all other systems I've used in the past?

There's a leap that you make when you go from watching systems that YOU care about to monitoring systems that other people care about. When you start showing off your shiny happy data, and this is where things get especially tricky. 

Inevitably, you will find yourself answering The Four Questions. These are questions which—for reasons that will become apparent—you never really had to ask yourself when you were doing it on your own. The four questions are:

1. Why did I get an alert?
2. Why didn't I get an alert?
3. What is being monitored on my system?
4. What will alert on my system?

...and a bonus question:
5. What do you monitor "standard"?

If you aren't prepared for these questions, you will burn hours and twist yourself into knots until you get it sorted out. 

In this session, SolarWinds Head Geek shares insights gained over a decade of designing, installing, and maintaining monitoring systems for a variety of enterprises across several industries. By the end of this fast-paced talk, attendees will know why THESE are the questions that always get asked, and have a plan of action on how they can be prepared to answer them.
