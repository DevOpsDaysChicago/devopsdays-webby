title: "Improvement of Serverspec integration tests in multi platform environments by the combination of Wercker, Walter and DigitalOcean"
---

**Abstract:**

Serverspec (http://serverspec.org/) is a common framework to test servers
provisioned by Puppet, Chef, Ansible, CFEngine and so on. Serverspec is
applied to a wide variety of OSes, and therefore unit tests are insufficient
for checking Serverspec itself.

This presentation shows the environment of Serverspec integration tests
improved by DevOps tools and services. Specifically the powerful combination
of Walter (https://github.com/walter-cd/walter), Wercker (
http://wercker.com/)
and DigitalOcean (http://digitalocean.com/) are described in detail.

The Serverspec integration test for the multiple OSes (CentOS, Ubuntu,
FreeBSD and Docker on CoreOS) is run in Wercker. The VMs of the OSes for
the tests are created in DigitalOcean. Walter, tiny deployment tool executes
the tests for each OS in parallel, which is useful to shorten the testing
time.
