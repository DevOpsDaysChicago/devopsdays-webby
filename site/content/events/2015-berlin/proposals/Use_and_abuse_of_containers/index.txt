title: "Use and abuse of containers"
---

**Abstract:**

Not everything which can be build in containers is a good idea to be
shipped to production. It might make sense to test a Hadoop pipeline
with data in dev and test environment, however is this a good idea to
ship this to production?

Containers are different from virtualisation, and their life cyle
should be treated differently.

Should containers be run on our current package based Linux
distributions or is the paradigm shift so radical, that we should even
rethink the way, we run our platforms. Is the additional effort of
container orchestration with kubernetes, etcd, flannel,... another
layer of complexity to be fought with or is it a strategy to simplify
our distributed systems in the long run?

If we want to go this way, what are the next steps in operations to go
forward on this road?

The talk discusses patterns and antipatterns of container rollouts.
With some two years of experience with containers in general and
especially Docker it is time to review container rollouts from a
DevOps point of view. The talk tries to raise awareness, that
containerized systems need also a new architecture for the data center
of the 21st century.
