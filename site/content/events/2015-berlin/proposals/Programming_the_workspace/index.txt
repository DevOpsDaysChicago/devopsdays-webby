**Abstract:**

Becoming a parent is an step in many people’s life path that will arrive
sooner or later, suddenly changing all your priorities. What before was
critical might become less important, but what will not change is your need
to work.

We all know there is no more challenging group of people than parents, as
they always have many issues to deal with: kids being ill, errands to run
for them, etc. However, parents can also be extra focused as they know just
how valuable their time is.

In this talk, we’re going to introduce ways companies can build a family
friendly environment and how work can be organized within teams by using
the many productivity tools available nowadays - benefiting both parents
and the child-free. We’re going to share the pros and potential conflicts,
with our ultimate goal to provide all attendees with ideas on how to
improve their workplace! In a nutshell, ideas, tricks and tips on how to
organize your time as a parent, plus how to optimize your workplace
interactions whether you have zero or more small humans at home.
