title: "Logstash - The state of the union"
---

**Abstract:**

With the release of 1.5, Logstash has been going throw a big reshaped, and
some very nice features were added such as the plugin ecosystem, a set of
highly demanded plugins ( such as Apache Kafka, CouchDB, RabbitMQ, etc )
and much more.

In this talk, we will walk you through the new features in the Logstash
1.5.x branch and how they can help you with your log processing
infrastructure. We’ll answer questions like “why a new plugin ecosystem?”,
“How should I adapt to the changes?”, “how is Logstash 1.5 faster than
1.4.2?”, “why do I need an Apache Kafka plugin?”, etc. We’ll also review
the upcoming improvements in next releases and how this will benefit your
monitoring infrastructure.
