title: "The DevOps Simulation Experience - or 'How to get everyone into the DevOps Boat?'"
---

**Abstract:**

Introduction of new methodologies and technologies always require changing
existing, proven structures and processes. This often causes suspicion,
skepticism and resistance; there is significant effort necessary to get
everyone into the same boat.  
Typical approaches to create adoption with
colleagues, employees and partners range from sending out emails, whitepapers,
sponsoring books, online training to prolonged presentations and workshops.  In
this presentation we show how a professional "Business Simulation" can help to
significantly accelerate the adoption process, reduce suspicion and cynicism
and create stakeholder appreciation at all levels. Adopting techniques from
"serious games" and "Experiential Learning", we have created an "in room
simulation", which lead participants in a virtual organisation (which is trying
to create and release applications) over 3 rounds from "Chaos" to "Order".
Students will discover challenges, discuss ways of overcoming them, implement
those changes and prove them in the next round. Each round we will measure
progress by a number of parameters:

- number of apps brought into production
- time to market (how long did it take to bring an app from its idea into production)
- cost and RoI
- application compatibility and performance

After those Simulations, participants are always extremely positive and
enthused and are much more open to change as the understand the bigger picture
better.  Using a couple of use cases we will also show, how we have deployed
this Simulation over the last 18 months internally, with business partners and
customers worldwide and explain, how this program has helped organisations to
drive change towards DevOps adoption.  We will also give some insight into what
it takes, to develop and deliver such a Business Simulation and talk about our
experiences about the simulation program.
