title: "Continuous Delivery DevOps"
---

**Abstract:**

In summer 2014, the continuous delivery engineering team at
Zalando--Europe’s leading online fashion platform for men, women and
children--began brainstorming about a distributed approach to
infrastructure. We started this conversation after learning from our
customer feedback that a one-solution-fits-all CI approach no longer
worked, given our team’s evolving objectives and business needs. Zalando’s
continuous delivery team took responsibility for the CI infrastructure in
place at the time: three central CI servers serving slightly different use
cases. The team adapted this trio of servers into a continuous delivery
landscape of multiple CI servers that can be configured to meet various
teams’ specific needs.

In this talk, Zalando Continuous Delivery Lead Lothar Schulz will describe
how his team successfully moved from a central, continuous integration
infrastructure to a distributed infrastructure. Lothar will talk about how
the team defined devops for this purpose. He will explain why a distributed
approach makes sense for a company (15+ million active customers) and tech
team (800+ members and growing) of Zalando’s size. Finally, he will share
knowledge that you can use to transform your own user feedback into CI
solutions that work.
