title: "Lessons from running a distributed delivery team"
---

**Abstract:**

Imagine leading a team of 5 20-something-year old skilled developers that need to create, build, run and maintain application code and its infrastructure for a successful publicly listed Australian company. Imagine if the 5 people are in China and you are in Australia. How would you do it?  I will share how I did.

I will talk through how I run a distributed agile delivery team including how to build trust between cultures and how to provide autonomy mastery and purpose to build an effective delivery team.

**Speaker:**
