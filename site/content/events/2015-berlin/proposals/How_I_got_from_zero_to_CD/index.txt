title: "How I got from Zero to Continuous Deployment"
---

**Abstract:**

I'm building a pet project from the ground up, using Continuous Deployment.  My
goal was to combine DevOps with Test Driven Development to provide a reliable
deployment chain and production environment.  In this talk, I want to present
the steps I used to get to a place where one commit builds and deploys
completely automated.  It also features monitoring and Zero Downtime.  Some of
the technologies I used are Git, Docker, Travis, Amazon Cloud EC2.
