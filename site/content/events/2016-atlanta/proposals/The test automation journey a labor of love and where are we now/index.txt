title: The test automation journey; a labor of love and where are we now?
---

Test automation has long existed at Autotrader.  In 2001, QA was using WinRunner.  Along the way we've used, LoadRunner, JUnit and HTTPUnit, Selenium, WatiN, QTP, RFT, and A3, Today the foundation of test automation at Autotrader is TestNG, Selenium-WebDriver (Java client), Selenium Grid, BrowserStack, Jenkins, JIRA, and Xenon, an in house test results management tool.
The presentation will include a brief history of test automation at Autotrader.com from 2001 through 2016, the current state of test automation, our future direction and how test automation plays into the vision of continuous delivery going forward.
