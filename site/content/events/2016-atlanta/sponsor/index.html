We greatly value sponsors for this open event. If you are interested in sponsoring, please [drop us an e,mail](mailto:<%= render(:partial => "/#{@eventhome}/_email_organizers") %>?subject=Sponsor devopsdays <%= @eventid %>).

<hr/>

DevOpsDays is a self-organizing conference
for practitioners that depends on sponsorships.
We do not sell product presentations
or distributee attendee contact lists.
Sponsors have the opportunity for
short elevator pitches during the program,
recognition on the website,
and social media before, during, and after the event.

Sponsors are encouraged to represent themselves by actively participating 
and engaging with the attendees as peers.
Any attendee has the opportunity
to demo products/projects as part of an open space session.
All attendees are welcome to propose any subject they want during the open spaces,
but this is a community-focused conference,
so heavy marketing will probably work against you when trying to make a good impression on the attendees.
The best thing to do is send engineers to interact with the experts at DevOpsDays on their own terms.
