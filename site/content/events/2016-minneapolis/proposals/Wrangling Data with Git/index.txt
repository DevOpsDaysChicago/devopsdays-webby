title: "Wrangling Data with Git"
---

**Description**

Git is a great SCM, and almost everyone is familiar with using it in that way. However, the features git offers, along with the indexing power, makes it quite handy to use for multiple types of data storage, including as a backend for visualization or data exploration.

Examples will be given in the talk for a few examples – including access tools – all of which are available on Github:

– Storing complicated data from REST APIs (diff, grep, log)

– Wiki/SCM with Git as a backend

– Graph data (such as movies) using tagging for cross-references

– Ancestry Graph (family tree)

Attendees will come away with inspiration and ideas about how to use Git to store, share and explore data without the overhead of a database.
