title: "Continuous Opportunity: DevOps & Security"

**Title:**
Continuous Opportunity: DevOps & Security

**Abstract:**

With DevOps practices spreading throughout many organizations, development and operations teams are creating tools and gathering ongoing data to deliver features to end users at an ever-increasing rate. This can be an immense challenge when the security team is left out of the loop, and an even bigger opportunity when security can bring actionable ideas to the table.

We will explore some concrete ways that security teams can gain visibility into a rapidly changing environment by adding value to the pipelines which power the DevOps practice. Attendees will leave with some approaches to incorporate security into the DevOps pipeline, starting with small, simple steps that provide insight into the flow of features from "idea" to "delivered‚Äù.
