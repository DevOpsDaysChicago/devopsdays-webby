Title: The Self-Designing Organization

Description: Conway's Law expresses Melvin Conway's observation that we are doomed to design systems whose structures mirror those of the organizations that create them. Forward-thinking companies like Amazon and Netflix use Conway's Law to their advantage. They shape their organizations to reflect the kinds of systems they want to create.

Conwayâ€™s Law, however, only comprises the first powerful principle of his seminal article, "How Do Committees Invent?". He went on to observe that designing a system is just the beginning; organizations also need the capability for continual redesign. He stressed the importance of organizational flexibility to effective design. How can we achieve this flexibility without descending into re-org madness? This talk will explore the relationship between organizations and systems, and present an approach that treats the design of systems, practices, and organizations as continuous and inseparable.
