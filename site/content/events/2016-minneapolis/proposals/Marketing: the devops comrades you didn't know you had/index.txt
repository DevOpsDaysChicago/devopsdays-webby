**Title:**
 Marketing: the devops comrades you didn't know you had

**Description:**

Development teams and sale/marketing teams aren't always BFFs. Too often, there is a master-slave relationship: either marketing dictates what the product team builds based solely on what is "sellable" with little consideration to timelines or what non-customer-facing work needs to be done, or the product team does a bunch of random work with little consideration for creating a strong marketing "story". But it doesn't have to be this way.
<p>
In the devops spirit of cross-team collaboration, why not recruit sales and marketing as your newest allies in the fight against workplace silos?
<p>
This talk will cover practical and battle-tested ways to work together towards a higher-quality and more marketable piece of software. From semi-obvious things like information radiators, to deeper collaborations in roadmapping and release planning, there's a lot more you can do than just invite the sales team to your stand-ups.
