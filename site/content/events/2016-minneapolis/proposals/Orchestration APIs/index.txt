Title: Orchestration APIs - The good, the bad, and the Sparkles

Abstract:

Orchestration APIs are awesome, so lets talk about orchestration APIs! The talk will begin with a super quick crash course on what an orchestration API refers to in the context of this talk, how they are used, and why they are greatest thing you have ever seen. Next we'll look at how _most_ people attempt to interact with orchestration APIs. This will provide a better understanding for why adoption rates of these APIs are surprisingly low and better illustrate the user interface problem. It will also provide those who have never used orchestration APIs some great laughs at the utter absurdity, while the rest of us can put on a proud face and laugh through the painful memories. Then we'll move on to the provider specific implementations of these APIs. We'll look at implementation decisions that were great, decisions that were really not so great, and some of the attempts by providers to make these APIs easier to use. Now feeling a bit defeated after seeing provider solutions, we'll have a look at how the SparkleFormation library and the sfn CLI tool makes these APIs not only usable, but a viable solution for building and maintaining infrastructure as code. We'll look at the underlying principles of the library and the features that have grown out of the library itself and the CLI tool. Concluded with working examples, stunned audience members, and thunderous applause. \o/
