**Title:**
The Banality of Effectiveness

**Abstract:**

By this time, it's clear that ninja rockstar firefighting is not the behavior of a mature ops team. Real results come from application of good practices on a day-to-day basis, combined with blameless, consistent post-mortem analysis.

We know this, but knowing it doesn't change how it makes us feel. Busting out crazy Linux skills to save the day is fun! Telling war stories about the time we stayed up for 72 hours tracking down an obscure heisenbug is fun! The transition from superheroism to safety – no matter how well we intellectually understand its importance – carries melancholy.

This talk is about how to find joy in doing operations the right way, and how to let go of our selfish attachment to rockstar behavior. Rather than pretending we don't feel a bit wistful about the shift away from fire-fighting, we need to acknowledge these feelings, examine them, and deal with them.
