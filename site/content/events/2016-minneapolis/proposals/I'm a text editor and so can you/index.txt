Title: I'm a text editor and so can you

Abstract:

I'd like to put a selection of people to talk about ways they use different
plugins and tools for the different text editors out there.

<pre>
Mainly covering:
- How to set up snippets for Atom, Sublime Text, NeoVim, Emacs
- How to set up ways to run rubocop inside Atom, Sublime Text, NeoVim, Emacs
- Ways to run rspec inside Atom, Sublime Text, NeoVim, Emacs
- General plugins and 'neat' things you can do in Atom, Sublime Text, NeoVim, Emacs
</pre>

I want, this talk, NOT to be a religious war, I want this talk to be informative and get
people away from using Notepad, or Notepad++ or even Word.

In a statement, "I realize there are strong opinions here, but I want you to be
informed not which is 'better.'"
