title: "Performance Metrics Driven Continuous Delivery"
---

**Abstract:**
A deployment pipeline speeds up the process of delivering new software releases, and automated testing is a key component to make sure we deliver releases that actually work. However, often only functional aspects are checked in those tests, and a lack of focus on non-functional properties like performance means we end up delivering slow software to end users.

In this talk we show you how to automatically capture key performance and scalability metrics (# of resources on a page, # of SQL queries, time spent in component, â€¦) about your application in every step of the deployment pipeline. Looking at these metrics across all stages and comparing them between builds allows you to decide whether a build should be pushed all the way into production or better back to engineering to fix performance, architectural or scalability problems.
