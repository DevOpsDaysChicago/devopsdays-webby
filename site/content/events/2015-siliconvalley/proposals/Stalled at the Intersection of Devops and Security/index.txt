title: "Stalled at the Intersection of Devops and Security"
---

**Abstract:**

The majority of enterprises are very concerned about the security of the software they are developing, but how can they secure their software without slowing down their velocity - or put another way - how can they move past being stalled at the Intersection of DevOps and Security?
In this talk we discuss
1. Why are we stalled.
2. Should we be securing our software supply chain and how would one do that?
3. How do accelerate our application security scans?  Can they be continuous like our development?
4. What other qualities are needed for our security tools to fit into a modern devops environment?
