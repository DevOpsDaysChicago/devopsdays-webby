title: "Not Everybody is Kelsey Hightower"
---

This is the tale of how we iterate on infrastructure, tooling, and product
continuously at $startup. It arose from a need for an infrastructure that would
allow us to continuously deliver applications; that would be appropriate for
distributed systems and a services-oriented architecture; and that facilitated
rapidly prototyping, building, and scaling new features. We went from a couple
of Ubuntu instances with services running in screen to continuous deployments
using Docker, CoreOS, Fleet, and custom tooling (soon to be open sourced). It
stars our intrepid heroine, $name, in zir first role as employee #1 at a
startup and the entire corpus of Kelsey Hightower's open source contributions
as zir trusty sidekick.

It's a tale of experimentation, failure, breaking things, rebuilding things,
and finally just running things (with scissors). It runs the gamut of emotions
in your typical buddy flick as our stars learn how to run software together.
You'll laugh as they try to run Kubernetes in production from day one. You'll
cry when they manually rebuild an etcd2 cluster because they have to learn how.
You'll be on the edge of your seat when they rebuild an entire AWS infrastructure
in 15 minutes. You'll smile when the complete development stack spins up in Docker
and no developer ever has to hit production databases again.

The moral of the story: you don't go from zero to Kelsey Hightower overnight.
Understand your needs, and use that understanding to describe the ideal
tool for the job. Evaluate multiple tools and find the tool or tools with the
closest resemblance that allow you to do the most by doing the least. Then
experiment until you get it right.
