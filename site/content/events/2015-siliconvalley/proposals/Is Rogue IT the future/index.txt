title: "Is “Rogue IT” the future?"
---

**Abstract:**

You see it over and over again, business units spinning up apps that IT teams, whether dev or ops, have to support later when they become mission critical. We rail against Rogue IT, or Stealth IT, often and loudly because IT is inevitably involved when there are issues with the application. Not only that, when it becomes a mission critical application, it causes more work for IT than it would have it we were involved from the start.

Despite our concerns, we don’t often put ourselves in the shoes of those we rail against to find out why Rogue IT pops up. Does the organization need to move faster than the “speed of IT” or build a cross-functional team that blends implementers with those in traditional business roles? What needs aren’t being met?

This presentation strives to encourage thought and start the dialogue needed to go from focusing on conflict at work to driving value by discussing why Rogue IT happens and if we should keep attempting to suppress it or move forward with enabling guardrails to make it successful for everyone.
