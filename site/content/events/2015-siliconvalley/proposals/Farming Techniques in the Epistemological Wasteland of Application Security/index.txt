title: "Farming Techniques in the Epistemological Wasteland of Application Security"
---

**Abstract:**

Application security has made progress over the years, but it has also made some considerable mis-steps focusing almost solely on developer awareness and training as solutions. This isn't a sustainable approach, however there is a convergence happening: Security meets DevOps and it's awesome!

Lets journey together to reclaim old truths and find new approaches to application security. We will explore ways to make a change for the better across all levels of the development lifecycle. You will learn pragmatic approaches that will change your development process, delivery pipeline and operational runtime.
