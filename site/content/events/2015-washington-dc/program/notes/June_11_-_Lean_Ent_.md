# Lean Enterprise

Facilitator:Marc Esher

Scribe:

Based from Exp and/while reading Lean Enterprise

Not in production = not valuable

Pivot - ![image](https://images.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.roysivan.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2015%2F02%2Fbuild-mvp.gif&f=1)

### whats the least to do to enable (product)  

* Pivot Proposal
* 4-6wk discovery w/ small team
* no prod
* focus on uncerainties
* leave parts for req's undone (build go-kart,  the frame around the engine and slap on wheels and get it going)
* build just enough to use and learn
* get real users ?? "testing" ??

### Key Princp

* --missed--?

### Reduce Waste

* 1 samll, xfunct exploring team
* 2 runway = hypotheses  vs reqs - Hypotheses are not requirements. The scientific method would have us define hypotheses to test. Defining "requirements" is non scientific.
* 3 principle of optionality - security wanted single sign on implementation first product for config of new req,
* feedback to team - this is what we need to get to work
* option not to do that

### enbling transformation

* customer was fantastic partner ( LOTTERY? Cash out?
* Real users early - feedback from users?
* freq proj checks
* unit test! and cont intgr8 early
* eye towards future staff

### What didnt work

*took customer while for customer to use app
*not everyone on board with "optionality"
*Bottlenecks - short timeline , hosting env strangled project - result value stream mapping to help avoid this nexttime


Plea: Enable expermentation

"no one comes to work to fail 70% of the time"
