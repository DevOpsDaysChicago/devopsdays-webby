# Terrible things about DevOpsDays DC

*
What sucked about DevOpsDays DC?  OK, maybe it didn't suck but what could have been better?  Share your feedback here!

*There was somehow not enough Nathen Harvey for everyone to hug simultaneously ^^
*We should have more open spaces, the groups are too big so not many get to participate
*The open space spots could be located in a better way in the main conf room. This made it very difficult to hear people in my space due to cross talk from the neighboring space:

This is a better distribution (in my opinion):

* Concur - the cafe space is bad for open spqce discussions, rest of spaces were awesome

More time for open spaces would be good; by the time we got into the heart of the subject, we were out of time.

It might be cool to have a small "Q & A" window after a speaker's talk - that way people with questions, or who just want to listen in on questions, can all group up in a corner and have a quick 10-15 min session. Anyone not interested could just take a quick break or talk amongs themselves. (It's always possible to just ask for Q&A during/after a talk, but only a subset might be interested or willing to speak up)
^^I am guilty of cornering speakers after their talks. Many questions are better asked after the official talk time is over.  I hope that the speakers are encouraged to be prepared for this. It could be fine to have a scribe present for the Q&A.

prep speakers on mic technique so we can hear them :)
^^agree the session on analytics and monitoring was tough to hear in several spots.

The party music between talks was drowning out conversation.  Is any music needed?

I wish people would take the logo stickers off their laptops and wear them on their shirts like nascar drivers, to help break the ice, like that one guy who was kind enough to wear a Haskell T-Shirt that I could identify from across the room.
