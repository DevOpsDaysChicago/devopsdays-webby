# Culture and Deming

Facilitator: Lilibeth Dineros-Snell

Scribe: Jeff Gallimore

* Trying to break down silos
* Why was Deming successful in Japan and not here?
* Gladwell's "Power distance index"
* U.S. has an "I"-centric culture. Does that have something to do with it?
* John Wayne "cowboy culture" - anti working together?
* Worked in Japan because they were enduring a crisis in rebuilding
* Japanese culture - taking pride in their work
* Cultural differences in consequences of failure
* Did lack of resources in Japan drive innovation? Versus US where things are plentiful?
* "Necessity is the mother of innovation"
* Level of complacency in 50's in US - US was the big dog
* Baggage with Taylorism in US - hard to make the switch to new philosophy
* Benefit of "greenfield" in Japan
