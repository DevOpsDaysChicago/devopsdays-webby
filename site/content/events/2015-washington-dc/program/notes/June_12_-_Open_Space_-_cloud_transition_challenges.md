# Challenges transitioning to the cloud

Facilitator: Avi Leavitt

Scribe: Jeff Gallimore

* Just get one environment setup and then move to the next thing
* One provisioning script is a start
* Find an app/system that contained with high probability of success and low risk
* Move front-end into cloud and keep back-end data on-premise
* Getting business benefit in optionality, speed, and flexibility
  * can take advantage of available higher level cloud services
* Worried about lock in?
* *outweighed by possibility of lost opportunity from slow speed
* How big do you need to be to have your own private cloud?
* PaaS competition in public cloud, but not necessarily same in private cloud
* Will get easier over time to build private cloud (?)
* Turn organization into a cloud-ready organization
* *don't need to talk to the ops guys to setup a new environment
* Tried to OpenStack in house and it was a struggle
* Running your own infrastructure requires upgrades and maintenance
* Case study: 75% cost savings moving away from in-house environment to cloud
* The dollar sometimes is not as compelling as the ability to get stuff done quickly
* Primary challenges
  * automation is a big project
  * big lift at first, but it gets easier
  * pick an automation framework and just go with it - you'll make mistakes
  * big time commitment
  * lack of knowledge
  * keeps people from investing time
  * security somewhat of an issue
  * attitude has changed from "no way" - if we do it right, we'll be more secure - but we can't do it right
  * security policies don't always translate well into cloud (e.g., password maintenance)
  * change in compliance practices
  * taking their servers away - pets vs. cattle
* Use track record of maintenance awesomeness with cloud-migrated apps
