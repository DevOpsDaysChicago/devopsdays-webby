# Distributed Teams

Facilitator: Adam Leff (adam@leff.co / aleff@chef.io)

Scribe: Adam Leff (adam@leff.co / aleff@chef.io)


25 participants, roughly less-than-half the participants work from home


* Some believe colocation is best
* Working remote has a cost, but the quality of life increase for some is worth it
* Full team on-sites are important
* If there’s a mix of on-site and off-site, make sure you defer to the common denominator (i.e. have most of your conversation in the medium that off-site * users can participate, such as HipChat/Slack)
* WFH offers a mostly-distraction-free environment, but still need face time with peers
* Video chatting helps, but “loss of fidelity"
* Time zone distribution allows lots of flexibility
* If you WFH, people find having a dedicated “work space” is important, both for the worker, and their family
* People are actively seeking out telework positions only
* As a hiring manager, being able to hire remote employees provides a HUGE potential pool
* On-prem location needs to provide adequate equipment to do audio/video conferencing - i.e. room systems, HD quality video, mics provided for ALL * participants.
* One participant stated the “office people” get to WFH on Friday - helped to
* Loss of a whiteboard is an issue…  WACOM tablet is a nice substitute
* Big HQ + satellite office: how do you make it better?  Only solution participants mentioned is full room AV systems, such as Lifesize
* Screenhero for pair programming (provides voice as well as control sharing), Floobits mentioned as well
* 1-on-1s with manager are more critical
* Manager role in conflict avoidance: be present, know when to bring people together in a different medium to resolve, act as advocate to other teams
