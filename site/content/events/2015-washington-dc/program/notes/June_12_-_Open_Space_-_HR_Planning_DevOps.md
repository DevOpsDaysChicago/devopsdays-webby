# HR Planning for DevOps Teams

Facilitator: David Kovach

Scribe: William Broach

At what point do you choose to add people to the team, What metrics do you use to determine this?

Jira reporting to determine length of time a ticket takes to complete. As the length increases, this could be a sign you need to hire a new person for the team.
Count amount of incoming tickets to DevOps team, this could be another metric to use to determine when to hire a new team member.
Large, longterm planned projects could be a reason to add another team member.
This is hard to measure, time spent, ticket count, ticket remediation.

another indicator could be other teams in the org complaining that devops is taking too long to complete projects, this could mean that your devops team is understaffed.
