# DevOps in Practice

Simple managment structures help

Separation of duties is still a reality, still makes sense from a security perspective.
Discourage and punish bad behavior, but remove incentives before it comes to that.

Ownership is key, but each component or team must treat each other like a customer.
The right of refusal is just as important as the responsability to develop, deploy, manage, etc.

Everything starts with communication.
