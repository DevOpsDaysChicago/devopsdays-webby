# Blameless Postmortems

Scribe: Jake Vanderdray

* Take the approach that systems are complex and that you can’t blame an individual, so that you can honestly find out what happened.
* “Blame is the expression of discomfort” - Is blame the right word? Maybe concentrate on just no repercussions.
* Maybe not focus on the individual and what happened, but instead how can we have a system that doesn’t allow that failure.
* If the problem stemmed from over-work, how do we fix the over-work problem.
* What type of mechanisms can be put in place to prevent mistakes from being possible?
* If you’re not doing post-mortems start with a formatted post-mortem.
* Ask "What?" happened followed by "How?” instead of “Why?”

* We need to use this to accelerate learning
* Re-brand as a “Learning Reviews”?
* Can be a tool for restoring work/life balance
* Difference between being accountable and being responsible
  * accountable - being able to explain what happened - this is the goal
  * responsible - taking blame
* The focus should be on looking on forward rather than backward.  How do we keep this from happening again rather than just why did it happen.
* What to do when management steps in during a problem making it worse and during a postmortem changing the direction toward blame.
* Maybe help measure the cost of blaming a person instead of making process changes to prevent recurrence.
* Point out that places like Etsy are successful because they use these methods to learn from mistakes.
* Try not to fight stupid.
