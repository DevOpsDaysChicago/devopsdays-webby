# Pipelining SCAP

Facilitator:

Scribe:  


* SCAP encompass multiple standards.  OVAL is the one for testing. (Open Vulnerability and Assessment Language)

* The standards were born out of configuraiton management and thus require testing against deployed software
* Ideally tests should be run against a full-scale system -- existing integration and/or acceptance testing frameworks are the natrual fit
* Most compliance frameworks mandate (or will soon mandate) testing of production systems

* Secure configuration is not a replacement for secure software

* Compliance requires the use of certified tools.
* The LGPL licensed OpenSCAP 1.0.x is certified, and 1.2.x is in in the process of certification
* Certified tools are also available from commercial vendors
