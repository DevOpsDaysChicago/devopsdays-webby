# Tricking Non-Tech Management into DevOps

Facilitator: Charles Bushong

Scribe: Jeff Gallimore

* Just do it and then show it to people
* Start moving really fast - people blocking it become really apparent
* Engage the people who care about moving faster - those who want business value
* Don't let a good crisis go to waste - take advantage of the pain and provide a solution
* You may need to go around a blocker - but better to go to blocker first and help advocate for them
* Figure out what the resistance is - have a conversation and use empathy
* Make concerns specific and then provide alternatives to address it
* EMPATHY! Be careful of people hearing, "You're not doing your job, your job is easy, or your job is unimportant."
* Drain the lake until you see rocks and then remove those rocks
* don't drain the whole lake - you'll see A LOT of rocks
* Connect actions to things that could have been avoided
* Lower the perceived risk to the decision-maker
* less risky alternatives
* education
* Connect the action to the business value and cost of not doing it
* Understand where the motivation to change (or not) is coming from
* Non-tech or tech = management who is not convinced
* Sad fact is you sometimes can't convince someone until there's a smoking crater
* Look for the "win" to build momentum - and those are sometimes small, but notable
  *ex: catching a bug before the customer
* Prioritize stuff that demos well
* Change culture to value work that increases stability (versus new feature functionality)
* Watch out for bad surprises for management...
* Show them better delivery wasn't a fluke - do it again quickly
