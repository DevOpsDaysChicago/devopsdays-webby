# Misconceptions about ITIL and DevOps

Facilitator: Steven Boyd

Scribe: Clinton Wolfe @clintoncwolfe


CAPTURE DISCUSSION NOTES, IDEAS, AND ACTION ITEMS HERE.

ITIL is a set of best practices around delivering value through IT services
ITIL is not (just) about change management
ITIL is more about incident response and management
ITIL has a steep learning curve, defines detailed processes, defines explicit roles
Roles => barriers between groups :)
Some need for this formallity at very large scale (enterprise, military)
 ITIL is a framework
 HIgh adoption cost, not a MVP
 In what sense is ITIL a best practice?  UK has some data on improved failure rate;
