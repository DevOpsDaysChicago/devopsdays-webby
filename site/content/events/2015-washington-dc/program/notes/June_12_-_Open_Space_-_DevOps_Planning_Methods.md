# Scrum vs Kanban for DevOps work planning

Scribe: Clinton Wolfe, why not

* Kanban seems to work better for interrupt-driven work
* Agile works better when people need to be accountable for deliverable on a certain (artificial?) date
* During release, a dev team using scrum/agile will move on, while ops is left fixing broken things
* one possibility is to reserve a dev sprint post-launch for breakfix work
* "Scrumfall" is a thing
* Agile may be able to cope with emergent work by reducing commitment (less than historical velocity) and then * tracking emergent work explicitly
* Major problems come from different teams using different methodologies
* But the nature of different work make it a bad fit (eg scrum for ops is bogus; leads to gaming)
* Can you split people accross scrum teams?  Yes, but it is an antipattern: serve two masters, accountable to neither
* VIsualizations - people like having the Kanban card move accross the board to completeion; can do similar things * with Scrum boards
* KPIs for scrum managers - KPI on velocity (leads to overcommitment), KPI on carryover (leads to undercommitment), * terrible things
* So much is dependent on staff!
* Product owners tend to have a short lifespan.  Successful one get promoted, unsuccessful ones get transferred or * terminated; doing devops work (systems-related) is very hard for non-technical people to write suer stories for * sucessfully.   Engineers are not great story authors by default.
* The tools don't help: they all blur lines
* Short sprints may help but may add overhead
