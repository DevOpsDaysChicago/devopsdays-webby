title: "Ownership –the key to DevOps, above even tech skills"
---

**Abstract:**

To some people DevOps is a simple as embedding people with operations skills into your development team to make turn-around time on infrastructure needs that much shorter.   To other it’s taking someone already on your team and training them up to become the DevOps expert.    It could be either of those things in part but neither of them are really the instrumental path to success in implementing and living the life of a DevOps organization.

The success of DevOps in an organization is entirely predicated on the concept of disallowing the phrase ‘that’s not my job’ and encouraging the embracing of the concept of total ownership.   Each and every member of your team needs to able and willing to see things that need to get done and figure out how to get them done.  Does this mean that you have a QA coding in binary simply because it needs to be done?
No, but it does mean that your QA can learn some things and facilitate others to ensure that tasks that need to get done are done.

Do you need an Ops person to spin up a new server?  Has a server crashed and no one is dealing with it?  Is there a new technology that needs review and assessment?  None of these things require that you wait for an Ops person.  They simply require that someone take ownership of the problem.

This talk will demonstrate through talk and stories what ownership in a successful DevOps environment looks like and why it breeds success.

Mike Hrycyk - has been trapped in the world of quality since he first did user acceptance testing 17 years ago. He has survived all of the different levels and a wide spectrum of technologies and environments to become the quality dynamo that he is today. Mike believes in creating a culture of quality throughout software production and tries hard to create teams that hold this ideal and advocate it to the rest of their workmates. Mike is currently the Director of Quality for PQA Testing, but has previously worked in social media management, parking, manufacturing, web photo retail, music delivery kiosks and at a railroad. Intermittently, he blogs about quality at www.qaisdoes.com.
