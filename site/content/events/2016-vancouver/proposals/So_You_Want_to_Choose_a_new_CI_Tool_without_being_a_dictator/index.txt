title: "So You Want to Choose a new CI Tool... without being a dictator! "
---

**Abstract:**

As part of ThoughtWorks, we have seen many projects where DevOps is a separate team and structure or not present at all. In my recent work, we had the chance to explore integrating DevOps in a delivery team from the start of a project, starting with choosing a CI tool. In order to help ensure the right tool was being selected, we crafted a decision process that helped us to both evaluate a growing number of options in the CI/CD space as well as examine the constraints and concerns our particular team face. This talk covers the process we followed for evaluating CI/CD tools, how we made a flexible decision, and some pitfalls on the process.

**Speaker:**

Elise McCallum is a Senior Consultant and Applications Developer at ThoughtWorks, with a focus in DevOps and integrating DevOps as part of agile delivery teams.
