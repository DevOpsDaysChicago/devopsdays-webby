title: "What do the recent CVEs tell us about Container Security compliance?"
---

**Abstract:**

Just this year alone there have been a big number of CVEs that impacted more than half of the web properties out there and there has been a lot of talk about how safe containers are after they achieve a running state and how they compare in levels of security to Virtual Machines.

Little has been said though about how container based packaging and deployments will improve or degrade the ability to keep us safe.
Management of dependencies will stop being a headache only for Security and Ops teams reaching also the ones on the very edge writing code and choosing what libraries to use.
This talk will be focused at three main areas in regards to Container Security.
the life cycle of a container as it relates to updates and fixes
Continuous Security and DevOps
Tips when creating a Security Pipeline
At the end of the talk I expect attendees to be aware of the process and mindset changes that are necessary if you adopt containers as a packaging and deployment model.
