title: "The Blameless Cloud: Bringing Actionable Retrospectives to Salesforce"
---

**Abstract:**

As organizations experiment with greater concurrency and integration between their departments and move toward a continuous delivery of customer-value, failure is assured. Asking "how can failure be avoided?" isn't as useful or relevant as focusing on

* "How does our organization react when failure occurs?" and
* "How do we create a sustainable, actionable process for describing, exploring, and remedying failure?"

This is the question that presented itself to Salesforce’s Service Reliability Engineering team. Their SREs had received training in incident response and management, but were still struggling with how to incorporate that feedback into the organization at large, to improve outcomes. Feedback loops weren’t always closed, leaving many opportunities for improvement lost.

This is the story of my months-long journey with J.Paul Reed and my team to identify the specifics of what made reliability retrospectives difficult to have, why actionable takeaways were often lacking, and how the feedback loops within the company’s operations organization weren’t serving Salesforce’s needs.

We then ran a series of experiments together, putting the SRE team on a road to improving their ability to respond, react, remediate, and re-incorporate learnings from failure into the organization.  

The Takeaways? 

* The importance of the retrospective process in building resilient, humane, operable systems.
* The common hurdles to holding actionable operations retrospectives and the experiments we ran to overcome those hurdles at Salesforce, hopefully providing possible solutions for attendees.
