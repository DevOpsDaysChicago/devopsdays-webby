title: "Consul for QA - integration testing a monitoring tool by simulating distributed systems."
---

**Abstract:**

Consul has been winning devops mindshare and establishing itself in production deployments. I will explore a less conventional use of this popular service discovery tool for a specific QA use case and discuss problems and successes of this approach.

We decide to build a means of extracting system architecture information from the performance monitoring data we collect in order to generate a structural overview of the components of a distributed system.

And we need to test it end to end. Build and deploy a wide variety of live distributed systems, capture enough data to infer the structure of the application, compare the inferred structure to the actual designed structure.

Use a service discovery tool to wire canned apps together using test fixture data, making test system configuration fast and repeatable.

Enter Consul:

â€¦ hard work and thinking ...
