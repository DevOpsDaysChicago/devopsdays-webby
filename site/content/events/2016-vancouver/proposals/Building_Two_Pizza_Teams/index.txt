title: "Building Two Pizza Teams"
---

**Abstract:**

In this talk, I will show how any organization can build a two pizza teams like how Amazon is doing it. I will show Microservices, Containers and DevOps as the perfect trifecta for two pizza teams and then talk about the key ingredients to building successful two pizza team. The ingredients include repeatable and portable pipeline automation, continuous insights, choice of tools and platform. At the end of the talk, any organization (whether it is a startup or an enterprise) will understand what Jeff Bezos meant when he proposed Two Pizza Team as the recipe for innovation at Amazon. With some help, they may be able to implement it in their organization.
