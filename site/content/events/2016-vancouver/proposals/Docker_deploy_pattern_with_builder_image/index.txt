title: "Docker deploy pattern with builder image"
---

**Abstract:**

Deploying and running web services using Docker has great benefits. It isolates the application, allows closer parity between production and development and easier deployment of generated Docker images. The best practises around building and deploying with Docker, however, are still emerging.

In this talk I’d like to explore one way of building and deploying a Python web application in a Docker image with the following goals:

- Keeping the Docker image small.
- Leave the build tools out of the production image.
- Reduce the build time by avoiding unnecessary dependency installation.
Our approach uses a “build” and a “deploy” image in combination with the Docker tool chain. Let’s see what you think 😄.

**Speaker:**

Sebastian has discovered his love for Python early on and found ways to use it successfully in various industries. Over the last few years, he's been mainly building things for the web using the Django framework. He's also enthusiastic about Docker and improving life, one container at a time.
