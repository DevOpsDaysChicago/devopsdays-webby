title: "Health checks for web applications!"
---

**Abstract:**

I'd love to chat about strategies for adding health checks to applications. How do you monitor the health of an application's subsystems? How should you add this to app? What should you log to help you debug later?

**Speaker:**

John Boxall is CTO at Mobify.
