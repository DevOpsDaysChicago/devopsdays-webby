title: "Applying CM Practices to Your DevOps Process"
---

**Abstract:**

Continuous verification, provided by our beloved dev ops teams, is one of the cornerstones of modern development practices. However, many operationally oriented teams struggle with "eating their own dog food", and those strict practices falter in favour of agility and responsiveness to the product's needs.

Revision control, unit and functional testing, and staging-production workflows can be just as important to apply to operational systems as to the product itself. As a dev ops team that has been rapidly growing in number of consumers, automation scale, and breadth of technology, we would never have survived without investing in the application of our own CM practices to the services we provide.

At Electronic Arts, we have employed a number of automation technologies in the past few years. From in-house CI engines, to various enterprise solutions, and finally to Jenkins, the unique features and architecture of each stack necessitated a similarly unique approach to managing its configuration.

In this talk, we aim to share these experiences in automation configuration, and the practices therein. We will discuss the pros and cons of various approaches, lessons we learned, and future plans we aspire to.

**Speaker:**

Sean Sutherland comes from a future where poor dev ops practices has led to the grim downfall of humanity. Sean has traveled to this time with the hopes of securing a brighter, more stable future for us all.
