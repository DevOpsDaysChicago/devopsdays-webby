title: "Lambda: Run Code, Not Servers"

**Abstract:**

A client wanted to enable their teams to take ownership of AWS projects in a manner that removed the client's CloudOps Team as a direct blocker.  However, CloudOps still needed to maintain permission oversight over the AWS projects.  Our team was brought in to develop a solution to monitor and store permission changes in AWS and if necessary escalate repeated bad requests to the CloudOps team.

We designed and developed a new solution to manage and govern IAM credentials across various organizations. The design was created to be scalable to multiple accounts in a repeatable fashion using Cloud Formation.

Lambda was used for data and permission processing. DynamoDB tables was used to store allowed/denied information. SNS was utilized to message resources of failed attempts.
