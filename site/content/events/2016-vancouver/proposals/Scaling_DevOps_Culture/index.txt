title: "Scaling DevOps Culture"
---

**Abstract:**

A follow up to 2014's DevOps days regarding Mobify's DevOps culture. We've since grown from a 50 person team to an international crew several times that size with offices across the world, and the way DevOps fits in our culture has changed. What does "DevOps" mean to a startup vs a medium sized technology company.

**Speaker:**

Kyle Young [@ksgyoung](https://twitter.com/ksgyoung) is Mobify's System Engineer, where he has spent the last three years championing DevOps, and building the backend systems and infrastructure that keep things humming. He is also Quidditch Captain.
