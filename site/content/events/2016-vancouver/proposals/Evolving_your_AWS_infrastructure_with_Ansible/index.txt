title: "Evolving your AWS infrastructure with Ansible"
---

**Abstract:**

It took Bench Accounting a long time to go from simple manually provisioned Java monolith app to a fully automated microservices environment with Scala and Node.js apps deployed in AWS.

In this session I want to share our experience using Ansible to leverage your existing AWS infrastructure and build repeatable environments using AMIs, CloudFormation and Elastic Beanstalk.

In the beginning I’m going to describe how we created playbooks for our backing services and also used Ansible for creating AWS AMIs.

Then I’ll talk more about repeatable environments and show how one can use Ansible playbooks, AMIs and CloudFormation together.

Finally, I’ll present the way of automating AWS CLI with Ansible for services that are not covered by Ansible standard modules, using Elastic Beanstalk as an example.
