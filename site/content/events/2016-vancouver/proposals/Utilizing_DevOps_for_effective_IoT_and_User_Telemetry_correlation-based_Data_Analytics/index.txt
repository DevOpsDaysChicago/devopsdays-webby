title: "Utilizing DevOps for effective IoT and User Telemetry correlation-based Data Analytics"
---

**Abstract:**

Two areas that have gained immense traction in the technology space recently are Internet of Things (IoT) and user telemetry analytics. IoT focuses on deploying and linking physical sensors together to collect and exchange information, while user telemetry focuses on collecting behavioral data and provides insight on application usage patterns.

In this presentation, we will provide our vision and framework on how to leverage Internet of Things and telemetry data together to deliver the most business value to the end user. Data from Internet of Things sensors provides insights on environment and physical information experienced by the user, yet it is telemetry and behavior data that allows for user feedback and validation. As a result, a framework that correlates data from both sources allows for the user to be front and center in any Internet of Things scenario, thus delivering key business value by improving the user experience.

As both IoT and user telemetry processes collect large amounts of data, we will focus the talk on two important areas, dev-ops (using Git, Jenkins and Docker) and data science, which come hand-in-hand in supporting data-driven scenarios. Having both the necessary development and operations support for both software and hardware, along with effective and efficient data science tools, is critical to realize this vision of correlating both IoT and telemetry data for the end user.
