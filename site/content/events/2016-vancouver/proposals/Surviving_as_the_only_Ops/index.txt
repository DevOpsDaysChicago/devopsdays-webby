**Abstract:**

​Many have ended up in their career, whether it is by choice or by circumstances, in which they
become sole developer who becomes the go­to guy for anything about infrastructure. They become the
linchpin in the development team and fighting the fires on the servers. This is especially true in start ups or
agency work where resources are limited and the pace is fast. This talk will suggest some guidelines such
developer can follow to survive and grow in such an environment.

**Speaker:**

​Shih Oon Liong is a Senior Operations Developer at Hootsuite, with nearly a decade xperience in operations and development for the web in both London, UK and Vancouver, Canada.  Despite being part of a company with 200+ engineers, Shih Oon is primarily responsible for managing both infrastructure and build pipeline that handles a significant amount of traffic (15 million requests a month) across 3 major applications.
