title: "Data Pipelines for the Lazy"
---

**Abstract:**

Mobify has access to and a great interest in copious quantities of end-user data regarding shopping behaviour and global network performance (see: DevOps Days '15 talk RE CDN performance). We're scaling up to do be able to churn more data and analyze it in new and interesting ways, all with a path of least resistance to keep things simple and easy for our data science teams to jump and use the tools. This talk will be a quick recap of the stack choices we've used at every stage of the pipeline, and take a look at how path dependency and "MVP" dev practices shape our final solutions.

**Speaker:**

Kyle Young [@ksgyoung](https://twitter.com/ksgyoung) is Mobify's System Engineer, where he has spent the last three years championing DevOps, and building the backend systems and infrastructure that keep things humming. He is also Quidditch Captain.
