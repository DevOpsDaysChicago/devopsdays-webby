title: "Change Management Does Not Have To Be Horrible"

**Abstract:**

How do we deliver outside of our iteration releases in less time than the five minutes I have for this Ignite talk?

So you have automated your deployments to provide rapid business value but the Product Owner did not want that feature released or even worse you took down the call center while a database script was running.

Now you need to figure out a way to give a heads up, gain approval, and provide metrics going forward.

Never fear â€“ DevOps and ITIL can play nicely together without the dreaded overhead and yet keep the developers happy and in control of production releases.

Like many of my peers, I have worn several hats from analyst to developer to QA within the agile space. As the DevOps Lead for IGS Energy in Dublin, Ohio, I am leveraging my past experience to help our development teams deliver faster, better-quality software using best practices within a .NET environment.
