**Abstract:**

Hey Developers, do you have a project that you need to progress on, but itâ€™s being held up by those annoying Database Administrators, with their pesky rules and silly standards? Database guy, do you have those dopey developers who know better than you about database properties and how their data should be stored, right? Managers, need to find a way to get the teams working together to keep work moving? This presentation will explore DevOps practices and tools that can be used to help collaboration between Developers and DBAs using tools like Github.
