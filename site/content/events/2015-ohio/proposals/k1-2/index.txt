title: " Container Orchestration Security"
---

**Abstract:**

There's been a lot of talks/blog posts/etc about how secure containers are and what their weaknesses are. However there hasn't been nearly enough discussion about the broader orchestration space. It doesn't matter if your containers are secure if you don't manage them securely. I'll discuss what to be worried about and what not to be worried about when it comes to frameworks such as kubernetes, mesos and their cousins.

**Speaker:**
