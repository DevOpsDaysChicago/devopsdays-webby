**Abstract:**

In School, the foundation of learning is Reading, 'Riting, and 'Rithmatic. DevOps has its own three 'R's -- Repeatable, Reproducible, and Reliable which form the basis for all of DevOps. Without school's three 'R's, we can't succeed in life. Likewise DevOps needs it's 'R's. Practicing them makes us 'able'.
